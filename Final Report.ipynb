    "We hypothesize that the number of profane lyrics will positively correlate with popularity in the genres of rap/hip-hop and pop. These genres often have underlying themes that lend themselves to the presence of profanity, such as violence and rebellion for rap and such as love and recreation for pop. Furthermore, these genres are generally meant for consumption by non-children audiences and thus profanity may be more present and thus more of a correlation with popularity."

    "In recent years, profanity in popular culture has seemed to be increasing, leading to many analyses and research articles on why we curse and whether or not cursing is good or bad. With the advent of the Internet, the access of progressively younger generations to more profane media has been steadily increasing. But is this just a flawed perception of culture and profanity prevalence that simply comes from the interpreter becoming older? According to a research article by Twenge et al., profanity actually is becoming more prevalent in written media (in particular, books), a correlate for culture [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In music, another correlate for culture, the presence of profanity also seems to be increasing, especially since the turn of the millennia. This is backed by data analysis as well, with around 40% of Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles having the label of 'explicit' from 2002-2008 and over 60% of these having said label in 2017 [2]. With this background, some positive correlation between profanity and popularity in music, especially within recent years, seems clear. Can this relationship be generalized further, where the number of profane lyrics correlates with individual song popularity?\n",

    "In terms of ethics and privacy, we did have permission to use this data. All the information, while technically personal, given that it references specific artists, their songs, and the lyrics of those songs, is publically available and is not sensitive information. We concluded that as this information is publically available it does not violate any privacy concerns. However, as we are using a profanity rating to attach some sort of value to our dataset, we acknowledge that as this is not an exact science, in terms of classification, we cannot use any specific datapoint as an example of profanity as we would not want to falsely slander by classifying a clean song as possessing strong elements of profanity. We handle this by not including any one specific point in a publishing of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also is likely to exclude certain time periods of music as it is only a collection of about 150 thousand songs and this is not inclusive of all songs, as there are obviously more than a hundred and fifty thousand songs. However, we believe that this data is sufficient enough, especially within the time period that we select for to give us enough data points to make reasonable conclusions off of. Therefore, although the profanity classification may be an issue, there should be no other ethical concerns with our data, given that it is non-controversial and publicly available.\n"
